                        How does food connect us to nature? The most obvious response
                         to this question is because, simply put, most of the food we
                        (should) eat comes directly from the natural world. Fruit bearing 
                        trees, vegetables, legumes and grains are all rooted in soil. If 
                        you eat animals, those animals will have consumed plants from the 
                        earth too. But before I start to sound like I’m teaching two year 
                        olds what vegetables are, the connection to nature through food 
                        goes a lot deeper than just how the food chain works.

                <p>By eating foods that we’re naturally meant to eat, 
                    we achieve adequate nourishment. The body needs 30 
                    different vitamins and minerals (mostly from plants) 
                    and 9 different essential amino acids (from protein) 
                    as well as 3 essential fatty acids (Omega 3s). In order 
                    to have sufficient intake of all of these essential nutrients 
                    we need to eat a well balanced diet that is ideally made up of 
                    mostly or solely, whole plant foods, as recommended by a vast number 
                    of professionals in the field of nutrition.

                <h5>Best Quality Product</h5>
                <p>Unfortunately the majority of our food comes from farms 
                    that degrade the land rather than resore it. Knowing 
                    where our food comes from is really important. A lot of
                    us are so disconnected from nature that we don’t realise 
                    how our food is farmed. Most of us simply stroll into the 
                    supermarket and pick up ready prepared foods from the 
                    shelves. We don’t have to venture out into a forest to forage 
                    for berries or hunt anymore like our ancestors did. Everything 
                    is done for us by the food industry.

                <p>Another really great way to have more control over the 
                    quality of the food that you eat in terms of how it’s 
                    farmed, is to grow it yourself. Not everyone has the 
                    luxury of a garden, but sometimes all you need is a 
                    balcony or a windowsill. When you grow your own food 
                    you can choose not to use chemical fertilisers and 
                    pesticides. Instead you can choose to use compost 
                    and work with nature for pest control – Ladybirds 
                    are fantastic aphid police!
                    When we make conscious food choices we will be healthy.
